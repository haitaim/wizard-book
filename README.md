# wizard-book

wizard-book is a public repository to store my attempts at the exercises in
*[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][1]*.

## Structure

Each chapter has their own directory which is further broken up into separate
section directories. For those sections, the answers are in an exercises.md
file. There are also separate coding answers in .scm files. Those may or may
not be slightly different to what is in exercises.md, and it is dependent on
whether I choose to refactor it if I learn something new.
